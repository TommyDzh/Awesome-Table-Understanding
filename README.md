:bulb: In the world of data science, tables are one of the most fundamental data structures. Understanding and extracting meaningful insights from tabular data is crucial across various domains such as finance, healthcare, and marketing. This repository aims to be a comprehensive collection of resources, research papers, tools, and tutorials focused on **Table Understanding**.

:sparkles: Awesome-Table-Understanding is a curated list of resources dedicated to the field of **Table Understanding**.

:fire: This project is currently under development. Feel free to :star: (STAR) and :telescope: (WATCH) it to stay updated on the latest developments.

If you notice any missing papers from the list, please feel free to [email me](mailto:tommy-zh.ding@connect.polyu.hk) or submit a pull request. I will gladly add it! Additionally, if you find any mis-categorized items, please let me know.
